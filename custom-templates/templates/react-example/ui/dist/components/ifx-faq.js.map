Its purpose is to support internal and\n\t\t\t\t\t\texternal colleagues create digital user interfaces with a high level\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof usability as well as a consistent expression of the Infineon\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbrand. The DDS does not focus on the content of a web application\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut it describes how the design of the application’s structure\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould be.\n\t\t\t\t\t</ifx-accordion-item>\n\t\t\t\t\t<ifx-accordion-item caption=\"How do I get access to the DDS?\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYou can use the provided Figma file as a foundation for mockups and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprototypes, use Storybook to view what UI components and variants\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare available and use code components provided via Storybook or\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGithub.\n\t\t\t\t\t</ifx-accordion-item>\n\t\t\t\t\t<ifx-accordion-item caption=\"Can I integrate the Infineon DDS into my project?\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYes, you can. We are happy to discuss with you which point in time\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand which scope of integration is bestsuited for updating your\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinterface to the Infineon DDS. (To avoid that users get confused by\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta mixture of UI components, we recommend choosing larger updates or\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttechnology changes as opportunity to integrate the Infineon DDS.)\n\t\t\t\t\t</ifx-accordion-item>\n\t\t\t\t\t<ifx-accordion-item caption=\"Are Infineon DDS components accessable?\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWe have taken WCAG 2.0 Level AA as baseline level for all design\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecisions inside the Infineon Digital Design System. To make an\n\t\t\t\t\t\tonline experience truly accessible you have to implement the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspecific code, content, and visual design according to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccessibility standard.
