/**
 * A toggle switch component for binary on/off states.
 *
 * This component is form-associated, meaning it can participate in HTML forms
 * just like native form controls. It supports form validation, form reset,
 * and browser autofill/restore functionality.
 *
 *
 * Code organization follows the Stencil Style Guide:
 * https://stenciljs.com/docs/style-guide
 *
 * 1. Own Properties (internal, not exposed)
 * 2. @Element (reference to host)
 * 3. @State (internal reactive state)
 * 4. @Prop (public API properties)
 * 5. @Event (emitted events)
 * 6. Lifecycle methods
 * 7. @Listen decorators
 * 8. @Method (public methods)
 * 9. Private methods
 * 10. render()
 *
 * Framework Integration:
 * - Vue: Supports v-model binding on the 'checked' property
 * - Angular: Supports [(ngModel)] and reactive forms (formControl)
 * - React: Standard prop binding and event handling
 *
 * Configuration in stencil.config.ts enables framework-specific bindings.
